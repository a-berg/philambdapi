title: About

This blog is a place to store and share what I learn about topics I'm interested in.
These topics will mostly be on programming, data science, machine learning and
mathematics, though; albeit I'd like to write some of my thoughts in other matters.
This is reflected in the name of the blog:

- phi, φ - philosophy, understood in a broad sense.
- lambda, λ - programming and computer science.
- pi, π - mathematics.

The style focuses on minimalism and responsiveness, hence, you are probably seeing this
in your browser's default configured fonts.  I'd like, however, to add a few things to
the blog and modify the default Hakyll templates minimally to personalize it, so this
blog is still WIP.

As for me: I'm just an engineer, doing engineering things.
